# Activity 5 - Validation

We have a simple form rendering and all the state is stored in one place! That's pretty cool.

But the aliens are very finicky about their form and insist that each field conforms to some precise requirements. Let's look at what they want:

| Label | Input Type | Values | Validation Rules |
| Species Name | <input type='text'> | - | Must be between 3 and 23 characters. No numbers or special characters allowed! |
| Planet Name | <input type='text'> | - | Must be between 2 and 49 characters. Numbers are allowed, but no special characters. |
| Number of beings | <input type='text'> | - | Numbers ONLY. Must be at least 1,000,000,000. |
| What is 2 + 2 | <select> | two possible <option>: "4", "Not 4" | "4" must be selected. Selecting "Not 4" should display an error. |
| Reason for sparing | <textarea> | - | Must be between 17 and 153 characters. |

It's unclear how a species is supposed to make a case in just 17 characters, but I suppose those are the rules ðŸ™ƒ

## Step 1 - Add validation rules

Have a think about where is the best place to validate the data.

Remember you're going to have to write tests for each component's validation messages, so it looks like we'll have to build that logic into each component somehow.

The smart place seems like our `onChange` handlers. We can intercept them and add some extra logic. Let's start with a text input. Up to now, they each look something like this:

`<input type="text" onChange={someFunctionFromProps}/>`

But we can intercept that function to add extra logic and then call the original function

`<input type="text" onChange={(e) => { // extra logic goes here someFunctionFromProps(e); }}/>`

We know that `e.value` is the current value of the input. So we can write a validation function elsewhere in our component and call it here. In pseudocode this might look a bit like this:

`const someComponent = ({...props}) => {

    const [ errorMessage, setErrorMessage ] = useState('');

    const validate = (value) => {
    	// perform validation
    	// return a suitable error message, or '' if no errors
    }

    return(
    	// rest of component here
    	<input type="text" onChange={(e) => {
    		const errorMessage = validate(e.target.value);
    		setErrorMessage(errorMessage);
    		someFunctionFromProps(e);
    		}}/>
    );

}`

-   Take a moment to understand the pseudocode flow above.

We're still telling the Form component about any updates, but we're also getting each component to check the value entered each time it changes. We're using empty string as a signal that there's no errors.

-   Add an `<ErrorMessage/>` component to each field. This should take `errorMessage` from the state as a prop, and display it in red next to the input field.

-   Use this pattern to add a `validate` function to each field using the rules the aliens gave us. ðŸ‘¾

-   Each field should now display a red error message if invalid data is entered.

We're nearly done!

Don't forget to take a break ðŸŒ¯

All we have to do now is add some tests to make sure we did this step right! Move onto [Activity 6](./activity-6.md)
