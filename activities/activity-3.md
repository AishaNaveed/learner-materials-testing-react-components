# Activity 3 - Build Your Form Simply

The simplest version of this form does NO validation. So let's build that first.

## Step 1 - Add input fields and their labels

According to the aliens, each field should have a <label> and a corresponding tag for the input:

| Label              | Input Type          | Values                              | 
-------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | 
| Species Name       | <input type='text'> |                                     |
| Planet Name        | <input type='text'> |                                     |
| Number of beings   | <input type='text'> |                                     |
| What is 2 + 2      | <select>            | two possible <option>: "4", "Not 4" |
| Reason for sparing | <textarea>          |                                     |

Remembering DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) you might recognise that it's good design to share code when possible, but it's up to you to decide how to split these up into React components.

ðŸ’¡ Don't forget we're in the world of React, so each input field needs to store its value somewhere in `state` - the `useState` hook will be required here.

As a refresher, for each field you'll need something like:

`<input type='text' value={myStateVariable} onChange='{doSomethingHereToUpdateState} />`

(Of course, not all of the required fields are `<input>` tags so you may need to remind yourself of how `<select>` and `<textarea>` work - luckily, they're very similar to `<input>`)

ðŸ¤” QUESTION - where is the best place to store this state? (Hint: think about submitting the form - at some point the whole form needs to know about the state of each component, so perhaps the form component is a sensible place to store form state?)

-   Code a simple version of the form that stores each entered value in state

**If you're struggling to build the form, there are some extra [Activity 3 Hints](./activity-3-hints.md) available.**

## Step 2 - Add a submit button

Lastly your form will need to submit. For now, just hook the button up with a click handler that logs to the console that it has been submitted.

ðŸ¤” Can you get the button to log ALL the form values in the console on submit? If you've designed the form carefully then this should just be a couple of lines of code!

Once you're happy you've built a basic form, let's move onto [Activity 4](./activity-4.md).
